This project is a full-stack E-Commerce application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It includes features like user authentication, product browsing, cart management, coupon application, and Stripe-based payments. Admins can manage products, orders, and analytics through a dedicated dashboard. The backend handles APIs, authentication, and database operations, while the frontend offers a responsive and modern interface using React and Tailwind CSS. Redis is used for caching, and Cloudinary for image storage.
